# GetItNow

An E-Commerce Website developed using ***Python, Django, BootStrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript***. It enables users to checkout without creating an account i.e. being a guest user as well as being a registered user. If you are a guest user you need to fill in your personal details such as email, name along with the shippping address but if you are a registered user you just need to fill in your shipping address only.

The products are also of two types, one that needs to be delivered and others that are online products that do not need to be delivered such as Audiobooks. If you are just buying an audiobooks you don't even need to put in your shipping address. The website is also facilitated with payment integration having options to pay using PayPal or using cards or net banking.

All the products are categorised according to their utilities, so you can easily browse through the website.
